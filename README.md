## About Me

I‚Äôm an ML Engineer and Data Science graduate student with a background in **ESG, health care, and operations**. I'm passionate about using data and machine learning models (RNN, CNN, LLM, RAG) to drive real-world impact. 
My work spans from **clinical ML research** to **ESG & chemical safety analytics**, combining technical depth with stakeholder collaboration.

Whether I'm building machine learning (TL) pipelines for risk prediction or designing dashboards for clients, I love being at the intersection of **data, impact, and people**.
